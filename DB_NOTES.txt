Using MySQL:

* Use mysqld to start the DB (may need to create “data” dir under installation?)
  - Can update Windows Services to start MySQL server automatically
* Log in with: mysql -u USER -p (interactive prompt for password)
  - Can use root or kkraft for user (password is old MCN one with substitutions)
  - I had to use the Windows cmd shell (Bash shell hung)
* MySQL port is 3306
* MsSQL commands:
  - show databases;
  - create database DB_NAME
  - select user from mysql.user;
  - use DB_NAME; (to switch databases)
  - desc TABLE_NAME;
  - User-related commands: https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-show-users
* MySQL 8.0 reference doc: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en
* My test DB is test_kk1
* Do “Register MySQL Server” in IJ (under Databases)? Probably only for Ultimate edition
* Not sure how to use MySQL Workbench
